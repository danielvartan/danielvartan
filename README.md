## Hi there 👋

I am a scientist with experience in data analysis, complex systems modeling, and the development of tools for open science. My career has developed in demanding academic environments, where I worked with complex data to identify emerging patterns and generate relevant insights. I am interested in expanding and applying my knowledge to add value in data-driven environments.
