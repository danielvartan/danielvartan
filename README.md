## Hi there 👋

I’m an interdisciplinary researcher specializing in agent-based modeling, complex systems, and research software engineering, with a focus on social, public health, and environmental contexts. I work fluently with R (including package development), NetLogo, and Python, and I enjoy creating data visualizations, GUIs, and reproducible research workflows.
