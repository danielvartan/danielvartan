## Hi there 👋

I’m a researcher at the University of São Paulo (USP), specializing in complex systems modeling, data science, and software engineering for scientific research, with a focus on applications in the social sciences and public health. I develop computational tools in R, NetLogo, and Python, including data visualizations, graphical interfaces, and reproducible analysis pipelines. I’m the author and maintainer of open-source R packages and agent-based models, and I also contribute as a developer and collaborator with the rOpenSci Initiative.

Currently, I’m affiliated with the Center for Metropolitan Studies (CEM/FFLCH/USP) and the Sustentarea Research and Extension Center (FSP/USP), both at USP. I also take part in the interinstitutional Resiclima Network and am a founding member and organizer of the Agent-Based Modeling Study Group at USP and the Brazilian Interdisciplinary Symposium on Agent-Based Models (SIMBRA).
