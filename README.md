## Hi there 👋

I’m a researcher at the University of São Paulo ([USP](https://www.usp.br/)), specializing in [complex systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system) modeling, [data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science), and [research software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_software_engineering), with a focus on applications in the social sciences and public health. I develop computational tools in [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [NetLogo](https://www.netlogo.org/), and [Python](https://www.python.org/), including [data visualizations](https://github.com/cem-usp/locais-nova-mapping), [graphical interfaces](https://danielvartan.shinyapps.io/cran-logs/), and [reproducible analysis pipelines](https://cem-usp.github.io/locais-nova-rfb-geocoding/). I’m the author and maintainer of open-source [R packages](https://github.com/ropensci/mctq) and [agent-based models](https://github.com/sustentarea/logoclim), and I also contribute as a developer and collaborator with the [rOpenSci Initiative](https://ropensci.org/).

Currently, I’m affiliated with the Center for Metropolitan Studies ([CEM](http://centrodametropole.fflch.usp.br/)/[FFLCH](https://fflch.usp.br/)/[USP](https://www.usp.br/)) and the [Sustentarea](https://www.fsp.usp.br/sustentarea/) Research and Extension Center ([FSP](https://www.fsp.usp.br/)/[USP](https://www.usp.br/)), both at [USP](https://www.usp.br/). I also take part in the interinstitutional [Resiclima Network](https://resiclima.com.br/) and am a founding member and organizer of the [Agent-Based Modeling Study Group](https://abmstudygroup.org) at [USP](https://www.usp.br/) and the Brazilian Interdisciplinary Symposium on Agent-Based Models ([SIMBRA](https://simbra.com.br)).
