## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a scientist with solid background in data analysis, complex systems modeling, and quantitative studies of human behavior.

I developed my career in highly demanding academic environments, working with complex data to identify emerging patterns and translate information into relevant insights. I am interested in applying this scientific rigor and analytical capacity to generate value in data-driven environments.
